Attended this amazing webinar on Git and Github.
It is always fun being part of your sessions as they are both informative and interesting.
The like the way you make your presentations attractive 
and give daily life examples to clear concepts.
I always wanted some guidance on open source contribution and today's session was just perfect.
Hoping to a be part of more of these!

THANKYOU BHAIYA!!
